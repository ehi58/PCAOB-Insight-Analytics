The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issues inspection reports that summarize the results of their inspections of registered public accounting firms. 
The PCAOB's inspections assess a firm's compliance with laws, rules, and professional standards, as well as their quality control system and audit work for public companies and broker-dealers. 
The PCAOB's goal is to improve audit quality and communicate their findings.

The PCAOB provides each firm with a report that summarizes any deficiencies found during the inspection. 
A portion of each report is available to the public and can be accessed with search and filtering tools. 
The public portion of the data is also available for download in CSV, XML, and JSON formats. 
The PCAOB also publishes an annual summary report that provides information on the inspections of firms with broker-dealer clients.
